This project is aimed towards first time voters who are unsure about what political parties that they stand with. The questionaire determines what political candidate someone is more likely to agree with. 
The demographics page uses the chatgpt api to determine who someone is likely to vote for based on their own personal demographics. My gov teacher would be happy if she saw it.
